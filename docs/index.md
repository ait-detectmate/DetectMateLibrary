# DetectMate Library

Welcome to the documentation for the DetectMate Library . DetectMate is a flexible, component-based library for parsing and log anomaly detection. It can be used flexibly in research applications, and when used with the [DetectMate Service](https://github.com/ait-detectmate/DetectMateService/tree/main), it can be easily deployed in microservice architectures.



## Getting started
