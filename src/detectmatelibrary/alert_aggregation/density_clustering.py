    # Implementation Details
    This abstract class requires the implementation of 2 methods in subclasses:

    1. One has to implement either the single_metric or the metric function.
    The single_metric function computes the distance between 2 alerts,
    while the metric function computes the distance matrix between a list of alerts.
    If both functions are implemented, the metric function will be used.

    2. The discard_alert_fn function must be implemented to determine which alerts
    should no longer be considered for aggregation.
    To this end, after each aggregation step, the discard_alert_fn
    function is called with the list of relevant alerts.
    It should return a list of booleans indicating which alerts should be discarded (True)
    and which should be kept (False).

    # Labelling of Alerts
    The group labels assigned to alerts are published in the output schema as a
    dictionary mapping alert IDs to group IDs in the "alertDetails" field.
    Every alert is assigned a group ID immediately after it is received,
    but as the aggregation progresses, groups may be merged.
    This is published in the output schema as a list of messages in the "alertDetails" field.
    Likewise, when a group is finished and no longer reachable from any active alert,
    this is also published in the output schema as a list of messages in the "alertDetails" field.
